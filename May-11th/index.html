    <p>Another big day today. We started by going back to Masashino Mori Diner for breakfast again.</p>

    <p>We then worked on figuring out how to use the train. Once we found the right line we took the train to Akihabara.</p>
    <p>When we got there we wondered around for a bit before getting to the main street where there was some sort of festival going on.</p>
    <p>It was insanely busy and you could barely walk. We decided to find a new coffee place and ended up at Vault coffee and toast. It was just down a small ally close to the main street.</p>
    <p>Just like the other coffee place, it was quite small. We got a window seat so we could still see the festival. We ordered a coffee and cinnemon toast. The coffee was ok but the cinnemon toast was really good.</p>
    <p>At this point the festival had moved down the road to a different area so it was much less busy. We walked around a couple of stores for a while. There were entire floors based an anime, games, and figures!</p>
    <p>We wanted to come back when it got dark and a friend told us about a massive shopping center just a couple blocks away. Since we sill had a couple hours before dark, thats where we went next.</p>
    <p>The building was gigantic! It had 8 floors and each had so many different things!</p>
    <p>My leg had started hurting from all of the walking and once we got back outside we decided just to go find a place to eat supper.</p>
    <p>We were looking for a restaurant that had a lighter menu (we were not so hungery from the toast) but couldn't find anything around our current area. We ended up going to 7-11 since we heard it was different in japan.</p>
    <p>We found that 7-11 WAS very different and they had salads, rice balls, and sandwiches! Our entire meal only cost 10$!</p>
    <p>It was finally getting dark so we went to look at the main street once more. It was definitely worth waiting.</p>
    <p>After that we took a train back to our place and went to bed. Between today and yesterday we had walked more than 35km! No wonder my legs and feet were hurting!</p>
