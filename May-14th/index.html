    <p>Today was the day we traveled to Kyoto.</p>
    <p>First thing in the morning we took a train down to Tokyo Station to catch a bullet train.</p>
    <p>Tokyo Station was huge and it was very confusing on where to go / what to do to catch the train. Eventually we made it to the right track and were on our way to Kyoto.</p>
    <p>Looking out the window was interesting since there were many small towns and mountains. (add picture)</p>
    <p>Once we arrived we took 2 local trains to get to our next hotel.</p>

    <p>We dropped our heavy bags off at the hotel and wondered down to a cafe we has heard about.</p>
    <p>The area was very nice and had many old buildings.</p>
    <p>After the cafe, we walked down to a main road to look for shopping stores.</p>
    <p>Kyoto was quite different here than Tokyo. It had so many tour groups and the stores looked more like home.</p>
    <p>After shopping around for a bit we headed back to our hotel for the night.</p>
