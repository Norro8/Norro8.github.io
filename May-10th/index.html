    <p>Big day today we started by walking to Masashino Mori Diner for breakfast.</p>
    <p>It was lightly raining most of the morning but stopped after we were done breakfast.</p>
    <p>We then just wandered around the area near Shinjuku Station until we found the 3D cat billboard. Unfortunatly cameras can't capture it very well.</p>
    <p>Next we headed over to a small coffee place. I got a cappuccino there. It was very small inside.</p>
    <p>After that we wondered around a bit more before going to a shrine.</p>
    <p>It was around 4:00pm and we had been walking pretty much the entire time. 
      We noticed we were close to Shibuya crossing (about 30mins away walking) so instead of heading back to rest a bit we decided to keep going as we probably wouldn't have another chance to see it.</p>
    <p>Shibuya area was quite a bit busier so getting there was a bit difficult.</p>
    <p>At this point we were starting to get hungery so we started trying to find a place to eat. It took a bit but we ended up finding a burger place.</p>
    <p>It was starting to get dark but we made it to Shibuya crossing. My legs and feet were hurting quite a bit.</p>
    <p>From here it was about 1 hour 20 mins walk back.</p>
    <p>Once we got back I just went to bed. I was too tired to do anythong else.</p>
