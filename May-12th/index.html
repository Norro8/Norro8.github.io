    <p>Today we go to a new hotel! We packed up and stopped for breakfast at McDonalds. Unfortunatly McDonalds is pretty much the exact same as in Canada and there wasn't much different on the menu.</p>
    <p>It was a good thing we learned the train system yesterday because it took 3 transfers to get to our next hotel!</p>
    <p>Once we got there and dropped our bags off we walked around the food and shopping area right outside disneyland. We ended up eating lunch at a place that had sandwiches there. Of couse we needed a coffee so we went to Starbucks right after as it was pretty much across the path from where we were.</p>
    <p>We still had a bit of time in the day and were deciding if it would be worth it to go to the main park just for the night. (We were going to Disney Sea tomorrow.)</p>
    <p>We ended up decided that it was and after a bit of trouble booking the tickets, we took the Disney train to the enterance.</p>
    <p>We were going to meet some friends at Disney Sea tomorrow but it turns out they were visiting the main park today as well.</p>
    <p>We met up right outside the main castle and they showed us around to the best rides and parts of the park.</p>
    <p>The rides were quite fun and very technicly impressive as well!</p>
    <p>We explored most of the park as it was getting dark. Just before the park closed they had an amazing light show and fireworks on and around the main castle. We watched it for a bit as we slowly made our way around to the enterance (to hopefully avoid most of the crowd) where we watched the rest of it. Once it was over we headed back to our hotel and had supper there before goind to bed.</p>
