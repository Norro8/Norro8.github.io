    <p>We visited Disney Sea today. It was quite different from the main park.</p>
    <p>The park was less theamed around disney characters and more different envioronments such as an old seaside town.</p>
    <p>We decided to walk around the park in the morning for a bit before meeting with our friends again.</p>
    <p>Once we meet up again we continued walking around and then went on a few rides.</p>
    <p>When it started to get late we split up with our friends as they wanted to try and get on a few more rides that night.</p>
    <p>>Unfortunatly due to the weather (It was very slightly windy?). The closing show in Disney sea was not running that night.</p>
    <p>We then headed back to our hotel to get ready for the next day.</p>
